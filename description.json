   "description" : "This Mod adds Blocks and Parts that were leaked and found in the game files!\r\nFor now there are 3 parts and 15 blocks, but more is coming soon!\r\n\r\nTo learn more about each block/part, read it's ingame description!\r\n\r\n\r\nJoin the SMLeaks discord server here:\r\nhttps://discord.gg/YKSrNW567G\r\n\r\n\r\nSubscribe to the creator on YouTube for more cool content:\r\nhttps://youtube.com/thedartfrog/\r\n\r\n\r\nChangelog:\r\n-V1.1.2\r\n-the quest marker preview parts now have custom icons (thanks Axolot for fixing the bug!)\r\n\r\n-V1.1.1\r\n-fixed a syntax error in the crafting recipes\r\n-fixed the pumpkin crafting recipe so that it now gives you 1 pumpkin instead of 10\r\n-removed unnecessary files\r\n\r\n-V1.1:\r\n-added 3 new parts showcasing unused QuestMarker icons\r\n-added Antenna02 part\r\n-added Spaceship Interior Gear\r\n-added old Spaceship Controlboard\r\n-added Water Barrel\r\n-added Plastic Pumpkin\r\n-slightly changed the default color of copper blocks\r\n\r\n-the mod is now usable in survival (with crafting recipes) thanks to QuestionableMark's 'Modded Craftbot Recipes' Custom Game which allows Blocks and Parts mods to add their own crafting recipes! The next Raft Mechanic update will include that functionality as well, meaning you will be able to use Leaked Blocks and Parts in there as well soon.\r\nThe 'Old Indestructible Block' is of course excluded from the recipes, as it would completely break the game in Survival Mode.\r\nIt may take a bit for the mod to be caught by the Mod Database, so you might not be able to use it in Survival right as this update goes out!\r\n\r\nLink to QMark's recipe-loading custom game:\r\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2816900681\r\n\r\nV1.0.1:\r\n-Fixed a bug that caused the description of Concrete Slab v2 to get cut off on lower resolutions (thanks @DANGER for reporting this bug!)\r\nV1.0.0:\r\nAdded 15 blocks:\r\n-Coal Block\r\n-Concrete Slab Block v2\r\n-Copper Block\r\n-Ice Block (in 2 versions: transparent and opaque)\r\n-Mechanical Block\r\n-Taped Plaster Block\r\n-Strong Steel Block\r\n-Super Strong Steel Block\r\n-Super Heavy Concrete Block\r\n-Test01 Block\r\n-Building01 Block\r\n-old Insulation Block\r\n-old Spaceship Block\r\n-old Indestructible Block\r\nAdded 3 parts:\r\n-Grow Light - Round\r\n-Grow Light - LED Big\r\n-Grow Light - LED\r\n\r\n\r\nGithub: https://github.com/TheDartFrog/Leaked-Blocks-and-Parts",
